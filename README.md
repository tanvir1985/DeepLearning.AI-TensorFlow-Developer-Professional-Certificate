In this hands-on, four-course Professional Certificate program, I learn the necessary tools to build scalable AI-powered applications with TensorFlow. 


- [x] [__Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning__]

This course is part of the upcoming Machine Learning in Tensorflow Specialization and will teach you best practices for using TensorFlow, a popular open-source framework for machine learning. 

The Machine Learning course and Deep Learning Specialization from Andrew Ng teach the most important and foundational principles of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. This new deeplearning.ai TensorFlow Specialization teaches you how to use TensorFlow to implement those principles so that one can start building and applying scalable models to real-world problems.

* Week 1: A New Programming Paradigm
* Week 2: Introduction to Computer Vision
* Week 3: Enhancing Vision with Convolutional Neural Networks
* Week 4: Using Real-World Images

This second course teaches advanced techniques to improve the computer vision model built in Course 1. Explore how to work with real-world images in different shapes and sizes, visualize the journey of an image through convolutions to understand how a computer ‚Äúsees‚Äù information, plot loss and accuracy, and explore strategies to prevent overfitting, including augmentation and dropouts. Finally, Course 2  introduce to transfer learning and how learned features can be extracted from models.

* Week 1: Exploring a Larger Dataset
* Week 2: Augmentation, a Technique to Avoid Overfitting
* Week 3: Transfer Learning
* Week 4: Multi-class Classifications

- [x] [__Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow__]
(https://github.com/tanvir1985/DeepLearning.AI-TensorFlow-Developer-Professional-Certificate/blob/main/Certificates/NLP%20in%20tensorflow.jpg)
In this third course, teaches how to apply neural networks to solve natural language processing problems using TensorFlow. I learn how to process and represent text through tokenization so that it‚Äôs recognizable by a neural network. Also introduced to new types of neural networks, including RNNs, GRUs and LSTMs, and how one can train them to understand the meaning of text. Finally, teaches how to train LSTMs on existing text to create original poetry and more!

* Week 1: Sentiment in Text
* Week 2: Word Embeddings
* Week 3: Sequence Models
* Week 4: Sequence Models and Literature

- [x] [__ASequences, Time Series, and Prediction__]
(https://github.com/tanvir1985/DeepLearning.AI-TensorFlow-Developer-Professional-Certificate/blob/main/Certificates/Sequence%2C%20Time%20series%20and%20Prediction.jpg)

On top of DNNs and RNNs, let's also add convolutions, and then put it all together using a real-world data series -- one which measures sunspot activity over hundreds of years, and see if we can predict using it.

* Week 1: Sequences and Predictions
* Week 2: Deep Neural Networks for Time Series
* Week 3: Recurrent Neural Networks for Time Series
* Week 4: Real-world Time Series Data
